# (Better&trade;) SoB_Launcher

## So what is (Better&trade;) SoB_Launcher?

It was a dark and stormy night. The Shards of Britannia development team decided to release a new launcher for their server, the infamous SoB_Launcher, preventing honest citizens from using their favourite tool, EasyLoU, as well as denying their right to multibox.

Rumors spread regarding other nefarious activities, such as the collection of machine identifiers and potentially other personal data.

But fear not, Avatar! Here you can find a (Better&trade;) SoB Launcher.

## And why is this Better&trade;?

Well, this (Better&trade;) SoB Launcher bypasses the (very rudimental, to be fair) anti-cheat code that was put in place to prevent EasyLoU injection.

This means that, by using this (Better&trade;) SoB Launcher, you can freely inject the Aria Client with your favourite tool, EasyLoU.

Yes, yes my friend. You can still use EasyLoU!

Not only that, but technically you will also be able to multibox.

## Ok, but will I get caught?

Well, as we use to say: use at your own risk, Avatar!

## Instructions

- Download the official SoB Launcher and execute it at least once. Let it download all its assets and do all its shenanigans..
- Launch the Client via official SoB Launcher at least once, and login into SoB.
- Once you are properly logged in, close the Client.
- Kill the SoB launcher! Close it, and never use it again. Rename `SoB_Launcher.exe` to something like `SoB_Launcher_Original.exe`, for future use.
- Place the (Better&trade;) `SoB_Launcher.exe` executable in the same folder where the official `SoB_Launcher.exe` was located.
- Launch the new (Better&trade;) `SoB_Launcher.exe` instead of the original one.
- Inject EasyLoU as you usually do, if you wish.
- Enjoy your freedom, Avatar!

## Ok. How do I multibox?

- Once you've run the official SoB_Launcher at least once, rename it as previously instructed and then just duplicate the whole Legends of Aria folder as many times as you want.
- Place the (Better&trade;) `Sob_Launcher.exe` executable in each cloned folder.
- Launch each clone via its own `SoB_Launcher.exe`.
- Profit!
